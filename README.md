# HackingWithSwift

These are my completed exercises from Paul Hudson's book/website https://www.hackingwithswift.com

These exercises were not copied from his github repo, which is at: https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift

Chapter 16 - Javascript Injection exercise isn't working in its current state and I should return to this at a latter date.

Also, Chapter 33 - What's that Whistle?, requires a paid iOS Dev account, which I let expire prior to working on this lesson.
